/*
  Previously, we learned that most programming languages provide an array.  An array is pretty
   raw.  To make it easier to work with, various abstractions can be created, such as a Vector.
   Static Arrays and Dynamic Arrays have pros and cons.  To provide an alternative, we can
   use a Linked List instead.  Classical Linked Lists are pretty raw.  At the most minimal of
   implementations, it is just a record (object) with the data and a pointer to next.  They
   were actually first described before the days of object-oriented programming.

  In this challenge, we are going to implement and operate on a classical Linked List.  Nothing
   fancy or object-oriented.  This will help to illuminate some of the workings of a Linked List
   and help set the foundation for the next few challenges.  One of the trickiest parts of working
   with a Linked List isn't finding a node, but having access to the previous one.  The standard
   Linked List does not provide a way for a given node to access any previous node.  Having
   access to the previous node (if any) is a critical part of manipulating Linked Lists.

  Your objective is to implement a classical non-object-oriented Linked List by completing the
   following:

    [x] Implement a LinkedListNode object
    [ ] .add() function to add a node to the current and return the new node
    [ ] .findPrevious() function to return the previous node (null if none)
    [ ] .find() function to return an object representing the node containing the next occurrence
          of value as well as the previous node (if any).  Use only a single loop to find them.
          MERCY: if you need to use multiple loops at first, that's okay, but you'll need to then
          optimize it to a single loop.
    [ ] .remove() function to remove the current node and return it

    [ ] .toArray() function to return an array of all linked lists value in the same sequence
          as they appear in the linked list


  HINT: A Head refers to the first node, and a Tail refers to the last node.

  NOTE: Do not create an object-oriented abstraction
  NOTE: Do not focus on edge cases or error conditions
  NOTE: Satisfy all the tests.  Do not modify or comment of them out.
  NOTE: When passing a node into the functions, we usually would want to start with the first node
          in the known list -- this would be the head.  However, it can be any node.  That is
          because a Linked List is technically a node that points to another node.  Therefore we
          call it _fromWhichNode_.  Sometimes its useful to use the head, other times its useful
          to use any other node (from the same Linked List or a different one).
